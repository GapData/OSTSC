\title{Over Sampling for Time Series Classification}
\usage{
OSTSC(sample, label, target_class, ratio = 1, Per = 0.8, R = 1, k = 5,
  m = 15, parallel = TRUE, progBar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{Univariate sequence data samples}

\item{label}{Labels corresponding to samples}

\item{target_class}{The label of the class which need to be oversampled}

\item{ratio}{Targeted positive samples number to achieve/negative samples number, with the default value 1}

\item{Per}{Percentage of the mixing between ESPO and ADASYN, with the default value 0.8}

\item{R}{An scalar ratio to tell in which level (towards the boundary) we shall push our syntactic data in ESPO, 
with the default value 1}

\item{k}{k-NN used in the ADASYN algorithm, with the default value 5}

\item{m}{m-NN used in ADASYN, finding seeds from the Positive Class, with the default value 15}

\item{parallel}{Whether to run in parallel, with the default setting TRUE. 
(Recommend for dataset with over 30,000 records. The using cores is 1 less than the total cores)}

\item{progBar}{Whether to include progress bars, with the default setting TRUE.
For ESPO approach, the bar charactor is |--------|100\%. 
For ADASYN approach, the bar charactor is |========|100\%.}
}
\value{
sample: the time series sequences data oversampled

label: the label corresponding to each row of records
}
\description{
Oversample a time series sequence imbalance data.
}
\details{
This function balances a binary imbalance time series data.
}
\examples{
# loading data
data(synthetic_control_TRAIN)   
# create feature and label data 
label <- synthetic_control_TRAIN[, c(1)]
sample <- synthetic_control_TRAIN[, -1] 
# oversample the class 1 to the same amount of class 0
MyData <- OSTSC(sample, label, target_class = 1, parallel = FALSE)
# print the feature data after oversampling
MyData$sample
# print the label data after oversampling
MyData$label
